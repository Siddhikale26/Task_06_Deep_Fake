# 🏆 Post-Season Interview with Emma Ward
*Simulated using AI on 2025 Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse stats*

---

[Journalist]: Emma, first off — congratulations on an incredible season. Over 100 points and 50+ goals. How does it feel wrapping up your final game in Orange?

[Emma Ward]: Thank you! Honestly, it’s surreal. Every game this season felt like a step toward something bigger. To be part of this team and finish with a record like ours — it’s something I’ll never forget.

---

[Journalist]: You had a huge performance in that comeback win over Duke — 6 goals, 2 assists. What was going through your head during that second-half push?

[Emma Ward]: That game was pure grit. At halftime, Coach reminded us who we are — a fast, fierce unit. I just zoned in, trusted my teammates, and we fed off each other’s energy. Those final minutes felt electric.

---

[Journalist]: Talk to us about the chemistry on the field — especially with your midfield and attackers. What clicked this year?

[Emma Ward]: The trust was unmatched. Olivia and Sierra dominated the draw controls, setting us up for early momentum. And the ball movement — it was just beautiful lacrosse. We weren’t playing for individual stats. We were playing for each other.

---

[Journalist]: From a leadership perspective, how did you support younger players coming into such a competitive environment?

[Emma Ward]: I always told them — play bold, play free. I remember being that nervous freshman. So I made it a point to lead by example and remind them that mistakes are just growth in disguise.

---

[Journalist]: Finally, what’s next for Emma Ward?

[Emma Ward]: I’ll definitely take a breather — maybe a beach day or two! But lacrosse is in my blood. Whether it’s coaching, camps, or training the next generation, I’ll still have a stick in my hands.

[Journalist]: Emma, you’ve left a legacy here at Syracuse. Thanks for your time, and best of luck ahead.

[Emma Ward]: Thank you — and Go Orange!
